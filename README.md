# Object-Functional Typing for Queryable Data Sets
Demo code for the accompanying paper.  Please see paper.pdf for more info.

To run, be sure you clone this repository into a directory named "cpp".  That is, override the default git name: git clone ME cpp (replace ME with 
whatever URL github provides where it says "Clone with HTTPS").

If you download instead of clone, please rename the folder to "cpp".

This naming is for **qmake** to find and connect project and code files 
without using environment variables, or any other build system, 
or having to hand-edit .pri or .pro files.

You need Qt and Qt Creator to run the code, but no other dependencies.  Open "qds-demo-console" and make sure the program runs correctly.  You should 
see a few simple console output lines.  

Interested readers can then experiment with the code by varying the queries 
and/or data.
